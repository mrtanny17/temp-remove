# temp-remove
Remove all the temporary files from your system in a single click.

Simply download the file and run it with your python interpreter or run it through vsCode. 
Don't forget to change the YOUR-USER to your pc's name.
It'll show "skipped files" in the terminal of vsCode, don't worry. It's because those files were open in some other services in your system.
Thank you for your time
